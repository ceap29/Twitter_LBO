# Twitter_LBO

This document is a case study of the Elon Must Twitter Leverage Buyout (LBO) of 2022. Its
purpose itâ€™s to learn about LBO models and the events leading up to the transactions that are
considered in the model. We consider three different operating scenarios to forecast Sales, Cost of
Goods Sold, R&D, and SG&A growth based on a set of assumptions. It should be noted that for
simplicity, many of the events have been omitted, especially those regarding the legal procedures
taken by Elon Musk to complete the Twitter LBO.
